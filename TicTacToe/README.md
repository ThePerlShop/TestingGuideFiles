# TicTacToe

This is a simple web app, light on business requirements but complex
enough to demonstrate a fully-tested MVC application.

## Installation

As this is a sample application, I recommend not installing it directly
but rather setting it up as for development in a virtual environment.
From the project root:

    perlbrew install stable --as TicTacToe
    perlbrew use TicTacToe
    cpan install App::cpanminus
    cpanm installdeps .
