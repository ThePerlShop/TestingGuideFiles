# Testing Strategies for Modern Perl

by J. Timothy King (GitHub: [JTimothyKing](https://github.com/JTimothyKing))

This repository contains companion files for the book _Testing
Strategies for Modern Perl_, a collection of best practices for writing
and organizing tests in a Perl project, including ones using Modern Perl
object frameworks, like Moose.

I am currently writing this testing guide in cooperation with
[The Perl Shop](http://www.theperlshop.com/).

You can get in-progress updates to the book by signing up here:
